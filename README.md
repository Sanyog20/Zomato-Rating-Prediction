# Zomato-Rating-Prediction
 
With the increasing demand for online food delivery services, Zomato has emerged as one of the leading platforms in India, providing users with restaurant ratings and reviews. This project aims to analyze the Zomato dataset to gain insights into the factors influencing the establishment of different types of restaurants in Bengaluru, focusing on the city’s diverse culinary landscape.

The dataset contains valuable information, including restaurant ratings, reviews, location, price, and cuisine, which are crucial factors in determining a restaurant’s popularity. By exploring these features, we can understand the dynamics of Bengaluru’s restaurant industry and identify opportunities for new establishments to thrive.

Bengaluru, as the IT capital of India, witnesses a continuous influx of people who heavily rely on restaurant food due to time constraints. However, the market remains highly competitive, with numerous restaurants serving similar cuisine. Therefore, understanding the local demography and culinary preferences becomes crucial in gaining a competitive edge.

The analysis will delve into various aspects, such as the impact of location on restaurant success, the influence of price range on customer choices, the prevalence of theme-based restaurants, and the distribution of cuisines across different localities. Furthermore, the project aims to identify neighborhoods known for specific types of cuisine and cater to the unique needs of the residents.

By leveraging the real-time Zomato dataset, encompassing data up to March 15, 2019, we will perform comprehensive data mining and analysis techniques. This project will provide valuable insights to restaurant owners, aspiring entrepreneurs, and researchers, helping them make informed decisions regarding the establishment, menu offerings, and target audience of restaurants in Bengaluru.
